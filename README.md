# Updated Instruction for scrolling test
1. I have done with three types of scrolling method
2. Scroller files to test:
    1. Method1.php: Simple CSS scroller
    2. Method3.php: Load more content scroller
    3. Method4.php: Automatic scroller
3. Please download all the files including CSS and Jquery folder.
4. Run all these above three specified files.
5. Notes: 
    1. This task can be done in many others way like AJAX, PHP/Mysql(if we have data on server(in database)). 
    2. Also content can be load with animations(css/jquery). 
    3. There are different jquery plugins for scroller, we can add plugin according to web application requirement and content     to show.
    4. Method3 is loading more data with the help of dynamic data(defined in PHP but not in MYSQL), but if we have database         then we don't need to create 2.php, 3.php and 4.php files to load contents.
    5. I have showed different methods because sometimes we have small application where we don't want to add javascript, to       avoid confliction to client browser if his browser javascript is disabled. Sometimes big application where we have dynamic     content there we can add AJAX or PHP/MySql scroller.
